        <h1>The Name Of Origami</h1>
        <br>
        <ol>
        <li>Many studies assert that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in China.</li>
        <li>Earliest records of origami indicate that it was used primarily for religious or ceremonial reasons. Eventually, as people became more interested in it, origami was used for decorative and artistic purposes.</li> 
        <li>The largest origami paper crane has a wingspan of 81.94 m (268 ft 9 in) and was created by 800 people of the Peace Piece Project (all Japan) at the Hiroshima Shudo University, Hiroshima, Japan, on 29 August 2009.</li>
        <li>With practice, origami can become a form of a focused attention meditation, a category of meditation that trains the mind on an object.</li>
